# MHR-Overlay_1440p
MHR Overlay - Customized to my liking (left aligned) and in 1440p standard resolution.

Modifications to original code created by GreenComfyTea, cursecat and coavins include:
- Changes to Colors
  - White Text Throughout
  - Green HP Bar/Red when HP missing
  - Darker Orange for user player damage, fellow hunter purple color left default.
- Changes to positioning of UI Elements
  - All UI Elements aligned on left side above Map default position and below squad names (This assumes that you plan on hiding the quest objectives UI Element in HUD Settings
  - Changed positioning of Time to be closer to centered under the time guage
- Removed Total Damage from visibility by default
- Removed Palamute/Palico damage/monster damages from counting towards player(s) damage.
- Extended all bars to be 250px and altered positioning of corresponding text
